- As a registered user of the system, when the system discovers that I have a valid account, the system should store my user profile appropriately on the front-end using a service.  This service will be used to pull current user information for the life of my session.
- As a registered user of the system, when the system discovers that I have a valid account, the system should direct me to the dashboard screen.  The dashboard screen should properly display my email address in the welcome message.
