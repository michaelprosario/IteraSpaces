- review clean architecture project standard: Prompts/001-CleanArchitectureStandard.md
- inspect stories here: Designs/userManagementStories.md
- Use AppCore/Entities/BaseEntity.cs for all entities
- When practical, use AppCore/Interfaces/IRepository.cs for CRUD operations
- plan implementation of AppCore and AppInfra layers
- Keep in mind that business logic should be encapsulated in Service classes in AppCore
